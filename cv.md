## Summary
  I worked for 4 years on the Belarusian Railway for distribution after graduating from Belarusian State University of Transport Gomel, Belarus (finished in 2012), Faculty of Electrical Engineering(Automation, telemechanics and communication in railway transport), professional qualification of an electrical engineer. In 2015, I graduated from the State Economic University Minsk(economist-manager). Then I spent 5 years on maternity leave to care for children. In recent years, I have been searching for myself. The most unrealistic dream was to work in IT. But, a combination of circumstances and the help of friends helped me get closer to my dream. I finished the courses on the Udemy platform and realized that this is what I was looking for. Now I want to finish RS-school with success and fulfill my dream.
