                    I’m an electrical engineer. In 2012 I graduated from Belarusian State University of Transport Gomel, Belarus where I was studying on Automation,
                Telemechanics and Communication in Railway Transport faculty. Then I was working on the Belarusian Railway for distribution for 4 years.
                Also, in 2015, I graduated from the State Economic University Minsk as economist-manager. Then I spent 5 years on maternity leave taking care 
                for my children. In recent years, I have been searching for myself. Work in IT always seemed for me as a pipe dream. 
                But, a combination of circumstances and support of my friends helped me to get closer to it. 
                Recently I’ve finished the courses on the Udemy platform and realized that this is exactly what I was looking for.
                And now I’m looking forward to finish RS-School courses with success and fulfill my dream.

                I have completed courses for Web development on the Udemy platform.
                During these courses, we were creating applications for weight estimation by height, currency exchange, reaction mini-game, etc.
